# Module 1: Prompt Basics

## What is a Prompt?
A prompt is your instructions to AI. Clear prompts = clear results.

## Why Wording Matters
- Precise words → precise outputs
- Vague words → unpredictable results
- Context guides the AI

## Types of Prompts
1. **Question** - Ask directly
2. **Instruction** - Tell what to do
3. **Scenario** - Set up a situation
4. ** Persona** - Adopt a viewpoint

## Exercise
Write a prompt asking AI to explain quantum physics to a 10-year-old.

## Example Solution
"Explain quantum physics like you're talking to a curious 10-year-old. Use simple analogies and avoid jargon."
