# Quick Tips

## Be Specific
**Bad:** "Write code"
**Good:** "Write a Python function that calculates Fibonacci numbers"

## Give Context
**Bad:** "Critique this"
**Good:** "Critique this blog post for a beginner Python audience, focusing on clarity"

## Use Examples
Provide 2-3 examples of what you want. It dramatically improves output quality.

## Set Constraints
**Bad:** "Make it good"
**Good:** "Keep it under 200 words, use simple language, include 3 examples"

## Iterate
First output is rarely perfect. Refine based on what you got.

## Chain Prompts
Break complex tasks into steps:
1. "Summarize this article"
2. "Now expand on the third point"
3. "Add examples to each section"

## Use Personas
"Act as an expert Python developer" or "Pretend you're a teacher explaining to a 10-year-old"

## Specify Format
"Format as bullet points" or "Return as JSON" or "Use tables"

## Give Feedback
"Too technical, simplify" or "This is good, but add more examples"

## Iterate on Output
AI output is a draft. Edit, ask for revisions, and refine.
